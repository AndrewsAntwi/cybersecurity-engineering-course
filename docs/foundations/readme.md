# Module 1 – Foundations of Cybersecurity

Welcome to Module 1. This section introduces the **core principles of cybersecurity**, networking fundamentals, information security basics, and practical exercises to build a strong foundation.

## 1️⃣ Core Principles

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. The goal is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information while mitigating threats and vulnerabilities.

This module covers the core principles and foundational knowledge required to understand and operate in cybersecurity environments.

### a) The CIA Triad

| Principle        | Definition | Example |
|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users | Encrypting data at rest or in transit |
| **Integrity**     | Ensuring data is accurate and untampered | Hashing files, digital signatures |
| **Availability**  | Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed | Redundant servers, backups |

### b) Additional Principles

- **Authentication** – Verifying identity  
- **Authorization** – Granting access based on identity  
- **Non-repudiation** – Actions cannot be denied after execution  
- **Defense in Depth** – Layered security strategy  
- **Least Privilege** – Users have minimal access needed

## 2️⃣ Networking Basics

### Network Components

- **Client** – Device requesting services (laptop, browser)  
- **Server** – Device providing services (web, file server)  
- **Router** – Directs traffic between networks  
- **Switch** – Connects devices in a LAN  
- **Firewall** – Controls network traffic  

### Internet Fundamentals

- **IP Addresses** – Unique device identifiers  
- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IPs  
- **HTTP / HTTPS** – Web communication protocols  
- **Ports & Protocols** – TCP/UDP channels (e.g., 80, 443)

## 3️⃣ Fundamentals of Information Security

### Threats, Vulnerabilities & Risk

- **Threat** – Potential cause of an incident (malware, phishing)  
- **Vulnerability** – Weakness that can be exploited  
- **Risk** – Likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

**Formula:** Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

### Types of Attacks

- **Malware** – Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware  
- **Social Engineering** – Phishing, baiting, pretexting  
- **Network Attacks** – MITM, DDoS, sniffing  
- **Application Attacks** – SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

### Security Controls

| Type | Examples |
|------|---------|
| **Preventive** | Firewalls, antivirus, MFA |
| **Detective** | IDS/IPS, log monitoring, SIEM |
| **Corrective** | Patching, backups, incident response |

## 4️⃣ Cybersecurity Lifecycle

1. **Identify** – Asset inventory, risk assessment  
2. **Protect** – Access controls, firewalls  
3. **Detect** – Logs, monitoring, anomaly detection  
4. **Respond** – Containment, incident handling  
5. **Recover** – Restore systems, lessons learned  

> Based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
